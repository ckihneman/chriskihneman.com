Useage of iframes to create and destroy views to regain memory via garbage collection.

* iframes for views

* minimal html skeleton

* ajax calls for gamestate, messaging feeds, and purchasing options

* in house wrapper (like phonegap)

Dom elms vs Canvas

* ipad dev = one css prefix

* dom elements > canvas draws

* repeated calls are super fast

* css re-sizes to every resolution

The CSS

* cure paths using 2 elms

* avoid poacity and box shadow

* use transforms first

* pseudo elements dont add leaves

The Events

* animationEnd and transitionEnd

* click vs touchStart (for a game, you need to trigger on touchStart)

Summary

* iframes

* draw with dom

* use keyframes

* save data in .data

Questions

* If you need to use shadows or opacity - just use a png?

* Performance hits on the iphone?

* iPad 3 upgrade for graphics?
